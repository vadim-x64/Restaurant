                The first restaurant was opened in France in the mid-18th century. One of
                the most famous restaurants, "Le Procope," was opened in Paris in 1686 and
                is still operational. It is considered one of the oldest restaurants in the
                world and became popular as a place for lunches and meetings of prominent
                writers and politicians such as Voltaire, Robespierre, and Napoleon Bonaparte.
                Restaurants gained popularity due to the development of gastronomy and
                food culture in France at that time.
